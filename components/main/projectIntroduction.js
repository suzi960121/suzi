        I've been working as a designer for the last 3 years across user experience, <br>interaction design, and web design on monetization, design systems, internal tools, 0-1 initiatives, and AI-powered products, prioritizing usability and scalability. My strength lies in visual and product design, and I often take on a dual design and product management role. Outside of â€œwork-work," I love designing side projects, some of which are shown here.
